# Finance_Manager
Using CSV files from my bank account, this program tracks my income and expenses for each month, categorizes many of these transactions, and lists them out in a google sheet. 

In addition, this program is shell scripted, so once I have downloaded a CSV file and put it in the correct folder, a single command from my terminal allows for the transactions in the CSV file to be listed in the google sheet for the corresponding month and year.
